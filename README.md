A robust PHP framework with a strong focus on IDE support through correct PHPDoc usage and maintenance. Other core concepts include:

* Straightforward bootstrapping with zero default project structure, allowing you to use the framework however you prefer.
* Environment based configuration.
* A simple, elegant system for provisioning and calling application services, where the bulk of your application code will live.
* Familiar HTTP request + response routing and lifecycle.

Tempest has been used in dozens of production applications, small and large, since as early as 2014; going through many iterations of improvements since its inception.
