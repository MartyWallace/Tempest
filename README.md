# Tempest

Tempest is a tiny PHP framework for developing small to medium sized websites and applications.

## What's happening?

I am currently making major revisions to the framework for a 1.0.0 release. It will follow a modern project structure and drop its existing templating system for [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/).

## Getting Started

1. Download and extract the files to your server - `public` should be set as the server root.
2. Tempest has some dependencies that are managed via [composer](https://getcomposer.org). You will need to run `composer install` once the files are extracted.
3. Good to go.

## Releases

* [0.0.1](https://github.com/MartyWallace/Tempest/releases/tag/0.0.1)
	* This release is explained in the [wiki section](https://github.com/MartyWallace/Tempest/wiki).
    * Custom logicless templating.
    * Easy to set up.
    * Runs correctly in subdirectories as its own application.
