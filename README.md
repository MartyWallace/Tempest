# Tempest.

A minimal PHP framework by [Marty Wallace](http://martywallace.com). The goal of Tempest is to glue together a handful of libraries for [routing](https://github.com/nikic/FastRoute) and [templating](https://github.com/twigphp/Twig) and provide a clean foundation for your application.

## Installation.

Tempest can be [found on Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/martywallace/tempest) and installed with Composer:

	$ composer require martywallace/tempest
